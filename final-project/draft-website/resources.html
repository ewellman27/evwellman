<p class="intro">Cats have a natural divinity dating back to ancient Egypt! In Egypt, our feline friends were seen as a sign of wisdom and companionship; <a href ="https://washdiplomat.com/divine-felines-shows-how-cats-played-everyday-otherworldly-role-in-ancient-egypt/#:~:text=Feline%20deities%20were%20seen%20as,sacrificed%20them%20to%20the%20gods.">"The dual nature of cats — protective and nurturing on the one hand, ferocious and aggressive on the other….along with their loyalty and independence, became symbolic representations of Egyptian rulers and gods".</a> In Egyptian culture it was not uncommon for rich folks, who could afford mummification upon their death, to have their felines mummified alongside them. These cats were valued more than most commoners at the time. </p>

<p class="info">
Similarly, Ancient Indian culture values cats much the same. Cats are seen in religious texts, oftentimes assisting humans. In The Mahabharata and The Ramayana, cats are pictured as powerful and benevolent shapeshifters. Similar to Ancient Egyptian culture, cats are often associated with Ancient Indian gods; <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/466/cats-in-the-ancient-world/"> "The esteem in which cats were held is also evident in the Indian cat goddess, Sastht, who served much the same role as Bastet and was as greatly revered".</a></p>

<p class="info2">
In China and Japan, cats were even seen as appointed overseers, Whose job it was to <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/466/cats-in-the-ancient-world/">"oversee the running of their new creation".</a> Cats are seen as pest control all around the world and in many cultures, however; there is much more to our feline friends. Their importance to ancient cultures around the world seems to all hint at one thing; cats themselves hold divinity.
