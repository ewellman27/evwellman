<p>For my final project I plan to make a website dedicated to cats. I want to create a sort of religious site that claims cats are gods. This website will draw in cat lovers from all over the world to appreciate cats for what they truly are. This website will educate the average person on our feline companions through engaging content, educational resources, and community events. These divine creatures deserve to be put upon the pedestal they have always claimed. These companions deserve our utmost devotion in a world where some see evil in their image.</p>

<p>It is well known that cats have always had a symbolic and divine presence throughout human history. One of the most notable instances can be seen in ancient Egyptian history. In Egypt, our feline friends were seen as a sign of wisdom and companionship. In Egyptian culture it was not uncommon for rich folks, who could afford mummification upon their death, to have their felines mummified alongside them. These cats were valued more than most commoners at the time. This distinct moment in history is something we would like to return to. Cats are not just simple pest control, but gods walking among us. </p>
