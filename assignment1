<h1> The Discomfort of Change </h1>

	This article is very interesting, and obviously from the perspective of someone a little older than my generation. The author goes into detail about how they long to revisit the early days of the Internet. They recite some of their experiences and how they valued the World Wide Web as a sort of medium for creativity. A significant amount of this article simply seems like a drawn-out mourning of MySpace. It is amusing to see the extent and which this person severely grieved the death of an early 2000s website, so far as to say it deserves to take its revenge.

	The author is deeply upset about the lack of personality that current websites possess. It is stated that modern-day websites are very cookie-cutter; "Users, in other words, must now operate within the hell of beautiful interfaces designed by experts". The author believes that the modern-day internet is used for interaction and entertainment rather than for creative or expressive means. In the article, the internet’s abilities in the early days are described as "limited," but this seems to be what the author valued the most from their experiences. Later on, the author then again mentions limitations but in regards to the modern-day internet; "In the age of smartphones and apps, our agency is only more limited; even what we see is limited, restricted by the proprietary designs of a small handful of companies". The early days of the Internet were limited in knowledge, content, and ability. The author then states that the modern-day internet limits the user creatively just because of how much knowledge and content there now is. I believe the author and I have very different views of the internet and of change. The author is very hesitant and disgusted by change or progression and almost seems stuck in the past.

	I believe that the internet has, if anything, made it more possible for creative people to express themselves, explore, and interact with other creative thinkers than ever before. Loss of things that are once loved is always deeply upsetting, but change also allows for improvement. I find it very interesting, particularly at the end of this article, that the author is so stuck on "revenge" for the "old internet". The end of the article focuses particularly on Facebook, which the author seems to have deemed the "killer of Myspace". It is mentioned that in many ways Facebook users have found ways to revert back to the Myspace aesthetic;  "these pages deliberately uglify Facebook, rendering a once sleek user interface deconstructed and amateurish, appending it with a Myspace-esque look, exposing aesthetically the control Facebook has lost both over its content and its brand image". While I find this an intriguing approach, to say the least, I also find it odd to focus entirely on how the internet has not met one's expectations when, if anything, it has become more accessible and easy to use as a medium of creativity.

	As a creative person who grew up with the internet at my exposal in my developmental years of childhood, I can say that the internet has only ever helped me grow and learn. The things that one could do with the internet in the early 2000s are still possible today, the only difference is that one’s resources are expansive and limitless. Change is often unplanned and uncomfortable but it also allows for different perspectives to be viewed and appreciated. To be stuck in an obsessive, revengeful mindset while the world progresses is to set oneself up for disappointment and unnecessary hate. The creative world is ever-growing and someone would be a fool to not grow with it.
