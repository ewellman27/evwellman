		<p>1. <em>Moana</em> (I find it a perfect movie! An Absolute Masterpiece even outside of Animation! Exciting, moving, profound, magic, realistic, with a fantastic story, direction, script, scenarios, music, songs, atmosphere and colors! And then the characters are simply wonderful, especially Moana, in which I see myself totally! And the many issues not obvious? I simply love them infinitely)</p>
		
		<p>2. <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> (Honestly, I love it as much as Moana (although it doesn't make me cry like Moana), only I think the latter is technically the best movie, so I put <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> in 2nd place. I love his Dark atmosphere, his being deep, romantic, magical, and besides, I love the characters of Belle (in which I see myself perfectly, as for Moana), and Adam (which is my ideal of true love)! A Masterpiece) - <b> <a href="https://qr.ae/psILhz">Donatella Alunni</a></b></p>

		<p>I believe <em>Princess and the Frog</em> is the best Disney princess movie by far. There is so much depth to the characters, each and every one of them. I feel like the typical 2D animated Disney princess movies beforehand limited the personality of the princess character herself and or made her reliant on a male love interest. I believe Princess and the Frog is an extremely powerful representation of a black woman living in New Orleans during the 1920s. This movie truly drives away from the “helpless princess” narrative and I believe it to have one of the most powerful messages of any Disney movie in general. The movie itself was foundational for all future princess movies and it was the last 2D movie that Disney animated.</p>

<p>The second best Disney princess movie would have to be <em>Moana</em> although I’d like to go more in depth than the author above. <em>Moana</em> shows a powerful message and a culture that most of the American audience is not familiar with. The ability to take stories from a culture and animate it into this beautiful representational piece is impressive. Similar to <em>Princess and the Frog</em>, it is important to show such a strong female character, and even more impressive to actually just distance the idea of a “prince” counterpart at all. <em>Moana</em> does a fantastic job of exploring a princess story that is different from typical Western expectations. I feel like this movie really set in motion the idea of sharing different stories and experiences from different cultures with the rest of the world. - <b>Evey Wellman</b> </p>
